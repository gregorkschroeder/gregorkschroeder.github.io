**A Comprehensive Evaluation of Population Forecast Error for San Diego County and its Jurisdictions**

*Schroeder, G., Kottayi, N. M., Burdge, B. A Comprehensive Evaluation of Population Forecast Error for San Diego County and its Jurisdictions. Submitted and under review*

This article investigates the accuracy and bias of population forecasts made for San Diego County and its jurisdictions from 1970 to 2024. Forecasts of total population are compared to annual estimates provided by the California Department of Finance to calculate forecast error. Both the accuracy and bias of the errors are calculated and analyzed by length of forecast period, rate of growth, and size of population. Additionally, the contribution of jump-off discrepancy to error is evaluated and a comparison to a set of naïve models is made to quantify the utility of more complex forecast methods. This article represents the first time in the San Diego region that forecast error has been measured across multiple forecasts and increment years.

**Development of a blood-based extracellular vesicle classifier for detection of early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma**

*Hinestrosa, J.P., Sears, R.C., Dhani, H., Lewis, J. M., Schroeder, G. et al. Development of a blood-based extracellular vesicle classifier for detection of early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Commun Med 3, 146 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-023-00351-4*

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers and it is often detected when it is too late, limiting treatment options and reducing survival rates. Identifying blood-based markers of pancreatic cancer may help us to diagnose it earlier, when it is more treatable. Tiny particles circulating in the blood stream, called extracellular vesicles (EVs), contain useful information about tumors, which can be collected with our innovative technology. In this study, we analyzed markers present within EVs and developed a computational tool using this information to identify people with early-stage pancreatic cancer. With further testing in real-world settings, this approach may prove useful for surveillance and early detection of this deadly disease.

**Early-stage multi-cancer detection using an extracellular vesicle protein-based blood test**

*Hinestrosa, J.P., Kurzrock, R., Lewis, J.M., Schork, N. J., Schroeder, G. et al. Early-stage multi-cancer detection using an extracellular vesicle protein-based blood test. Commun Med 2, 29 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-00088-6*

Finding cancer early can make treatment easier and improve odds of survival. However, many tumors go unnoticed until they have grown large enough to cause symptoms. While scans can detect tumors earlier, routine full-body imaging is impractical for population screening. New cancer detection methods being explored are based on observations that tumors release tiny particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the bloodstream, containing proteins from the tumor. Here, we used a method to purify EVs from patients’ blood followed by a method to detect tumor proteins in the EVs. Our method quickly and accurately detected early-stage pancreatic, ovarian, or bladder cancer. With further testing, this method may provide a useful screening tool for clinicians to detect cancers at an earlier stage.

**San Diego County's Successful Treatment and Reentry (STAR)**

*Keaton, S., Schroeder, G., Vaughs, C., Jones, E., & Burke, C. (2021). San Diego County Proposition 47 Grant Final Evaluation Report. https://www.sandag.org/-/media/SANDAG/Documents/PDF/data-and-research/criminal-justice-and-public-safety/evaluation-services/adults/cj-evaluation-san-diego-countys-successful-treatment-and-reentry-evaluation-report-2021-09-01.pdf*

The Succesful, Treatment, and Reentry (S.T.A.R) project aimed to increase the supervision success of high-risk offenders, especially those who exhibit alcohol and other drug (AOD) and/or mental health issues, by reducing revocations and recidivism through a collaborative, evidence-based probation supervision strategy. This project included the integration of multiple teams under one integrated service approach. Coordinating agencies included Behavioral Health Services, San Diego Probation’s formal supervision division, the Sheriff's in-custody counseling services, and SANDAG as the research partner. Participation in S.T.A.R. included a personalized case plan, which considered client-specific assessment information, developed collaboratively by the service provider and Probation. This project strived to reduce recidivism for medium- and high-risk probationers struggling with mental health, substance abuse, or co-occurring issues by directly addressing these underlying criminogenic needs through treatment services while providing holistic supportive services to ensure long-term success in the community.


**San Diego County Proposition 47 Grant Final Evaluation Report**

*Telson, K., Keaton, S., Jones, E., Schroeder, G., & Burke, C. (2021). San Diego County Proposition 47 Grant Final Evaluation Report. https://www.sandag.org/-/media/SANDAG/Documents/PDF/data-and-research/criminal-justice-and-public-safety/evaluation-services/adults/cj-bulletin-san-diego-county-prop-47-grant-final-evaluation-report-2021-09-01.pdf*

The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) was responsible for conducting both a process and impact evaluation to measure the extent to which the CoSRR and S.M.A.R.T. programs were implemented as designed and how effective the programs were in reaching their goals. The evaluation was part of the project from inception, with data being collected, cleaned, analyzed, and presented using a data dashboard that was shared monthly with partners to inform the implementation process. The evaluation design utilized a mixed-method, pre–post quasi-experimental approach that measured change in recidivism over time (i.e., three-years prior compared to up to three-years post).

**The Role of Race and Ethnicity in the San Diego County Juvenile Justice System**

*Keaton, S., Sauer, K., Schroeder, G., & Burke, C. (2020). The Role of Race and Ethnicity in the San Diego County Juvenile Justice System. https://www.sandag.org/data-and-research/criminal-justice-and-public-safety/evaluation-services/-/media/3D720CCFEC8E4D6A9362EF6BE52A7B92.ashx*

The overrepresentation of youth of color in the juvenile justice system is indisputable. This fact, along with the foundational rehabilitative tenet of the juvenile system has driven local juvenile justice stakeholders to consistently examine and modify the system to better serve San Diego County youth and their families under their care. This study was the third of its kind undertaken by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) Applied Research Division (ARD) at the direction of San Diego County juvenile justice partners and was conducted during a transformation period of the County’s Juvenile Probation Department and its partners. The rigorous review of the degree of racial/ethnic overrepresentation in the juvenile justice system, and more importantly, the reasons driving any differences was conducted by SANDAG ARD, in cooperation with the County’s Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (RRED) Committee.

**Veterans Moving Forward: Process and Impact Evaluation Results**

*Burke, C., Keaton, S., Schroeder, G., & Ocheltree, K. (2019). Veterans Moving Forward: Process and Impact Evaluation Results of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department VMF Program. https://www.sandag.org/-/media/SANDAG/Documents/PDF/data-and-research/criminal-justice-and-public-safety/evaluation-services/adults/cj-evaluation-veterans-moving-forward-evaluation-results-2019-03-01.pdf*

In 2014, San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) applied for and received funding from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct a process and impact evaluation of the Veterans Moving Forward (VMF) program that was created by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department in partnership with the San Diego Veterans Administration (VA) in 2013.
